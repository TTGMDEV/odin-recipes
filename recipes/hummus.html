<h2>What is Hummus?</h2>
<p>Hummus is basically chickpea paste. 
   In this hummus recipe, adapted from "How to Cook Everything," tahini is essential, as are garlic and lemon.
   But this dip is also flexible: cumin and pimentón are optional, as, again, are herbs or blends like za’atar.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>2cups drained well-cooked or canned chickpeas, cooking liquid reserved if possible</li>
    <li>½cup tahini, with some of its oil</li>
    <li>¼cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2cloves peeled garlic, or to taste</li>
    <li>Juice of 1 lemon, plus more as needed</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin or paprika, or to taste, plus a sprinkling for garnish</li>
    <li>Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish</li>
    
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Put the chickpeas, tahini, cumin or paprika, oil, garlic and lemon juice in a food processor, sprinkle with salt and pepper and begin to process; add chickpea-cooking liquid or water as needed to produce a smooth purée.</li>
    <li>Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more salt, pepper or lemon juice as needed. Serve, drizzled with some olive oil and sprinkled with a bit of cumin or paprika and some parsley.</li>
   </ol>
