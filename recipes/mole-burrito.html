<h2>What is Mole?</h2>
<p>A mole (pronounced “moh-leh”) is a thick, dark sauce, complex in flavour, containing 20 ingredients on average. There are many versions of Mexican mole poblano, which can be traced back to the Aztecs. </p>

<h3>Lets get started!</h3>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>Marinate the chicken beforehand for extra juicyness and flavor! This should be done about a day before.</p>
<h4>Lets get cooking!</h4>
<ol>

    <li>De-seed the ancho and rocoto chillies (keep the seeds), discarding the stems. Toast the chillies in a dry pan for a minute or so. Tip into a bowl, cover with boiling water and rehydrate for 20 minutes. Drain, set aside one rocoto chilli for the chicken, then finely chop the rest.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds, almonds, bread, spices and reserved chilli seeds in a dry pan until fragrant; set aside to cool completely then grind to a powder.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the raisins and cook briefly until they plump up, then add the pumpkin seeds and let them brown a little. Add the onion and cook for 8 minutes until soft and golden. Add the chopped chillies and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and orange juice and reduce slightly.</li>
    <li>Add the ground spice, seed and nut mixture, plus 300ml of stock, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add another 200ml stock and blitz until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add the chocolate and the remaining stock to the sauce. Simmer gently until the chocolate has melted and the sauce has a thick gravy-like consistency. Season to taste and blend once more to get the sauce as smooth as possible. Thin down with a little water if needed. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Pat the chicken dry using kitchen paper; trim away excess skin. Finely chop the reserved rocoto chilli and place in a bowl along with the rest of the marinated chicken ingredients. Mix well, add the chicken and turn to coat. Let the chicken come to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Light your barbecue for indirect cooking (coals heaped to one side). If you have a chunk of oak wood, put that on top of the coals about 10 minutes before you cook. When the coals are white, put the chicken thighs on the grill above the coals, and cook for 5 minutes. Turn with tongs, cook for another 5 minutes until evenly browned. Flip the chicken again then transfer to the other side of the barbecue (indirect heat) and cook for a further 30 minutes (with the lid on if the barbecue has one, and vent slightly open) or until cooked through (the internal temperature should be 73°C, using a digital thermometer probe). Remove the chicken to a board.</li>
    <li>Wrap the tortillas in a foil parcel and cook over indirect heat for 10 minutes, turning once or twice. Meanwhile, shred the chicken, discarding the skin and bones. Spoon a layer of cooked rice onto each tortilla, followed by shredded chicken, some of the mole poblano and soured cream. Fold in the ends of each tortilla, roll up in tin foil and place back over indirect heat to warm through for 5 minutes. Serve with ice-cold Mexican beer, with a wedge of lime in the bottle.</li>

<h4>Tip</h4>
<p>To cook without a barbecue, roast the chicken thighs for 35-40 minutes in a preheated oven at 200°C, fan 180°C, gas 6. Warm the foil parcel of tortillas for 8-10 minutes at 180°C, fan 160°C, gas 4, and the filled burritos for 5 minutes at the same temperature.</p>
